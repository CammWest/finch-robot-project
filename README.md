# Final Project: Finch Robot Challenges

## Essential Question
How can we apply object-oriented programming principles and Java concepts to create interactive, autonomous robot behaviors that solve real-world challenges?

## Project Overview
In this project-based learning experience, you will program a Finch 2.0 robot to perform one of three challenges:
1. Choreograph a dance routine (with movement, lights, and sound)
2. Create an artistic drawing using the robot's movements
3. Navigate a maze autonomously

Your program must demonstrate your understanding of Java programming concepts from APCSA and object-oriented design principles while creating an engaging robot behavior.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply Java programming concepts in a physical computing context
- Implement object-oriented design principles
- Develop problem-solving skills through algorithm development
- Create well-documented and maintainable code
- Practice technical communication through presentations and documentation

## Description of design Choices
- We wanted to make a main dance and then a shimmy and then back to a main dance
- We also wanted to make it look like a party so we have changing light colors

## Challenges faced and solutions
- We couldn't play music while it danced, so we decided to just play a song at the end
- We also ran into a problem where it sometimes skipped a not in our song, it was uncontrollable on when or what note it missed.

## Future enhancements
- Make a more complex dance and have a second finch playing music while it dances
- utilize the lights on the tail to maybe make it say something like "Just Dance"
